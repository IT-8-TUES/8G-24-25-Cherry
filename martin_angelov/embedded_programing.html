        Embedded programming languages are specialized languages designed for programming embedded systems, which are computer systems integrated into other devices or products. These languages enable developers to write software that directly interacts with hardware components, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. Embedded programming is crucial for creating applications in various fields, including automotive, consumer electronics, medical devices, and industrial automation.<br><br>
        The most common embedded programming languages include C, C++, and assembly language. C is widely used due to its efficiency and low-level access to hardware, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. C++ builds on C by adding object-oriented features, allowing for more complex software design. Assembly language provides a low-level interface to the hardware, enabling precise control over system resources but requiring a deep understanding of the underlying architecture.<br><br>
