    <h1>Programming languages</h1>
    <p id="main_p">
        Programming languages are used to create software applications. They provide a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
        Programming languages allow developers to communicate with computers and control their behavior. Each language has its own syntax, features, and areas where it excels.
        Some languages are designed for building user interfaces, while others are better suited for handling data processing, server-side logic, or networking tasks.
        Over time, hundreds of programming languages have been developed, each serving different purposes and industries.<br>
        It is split into 3 main parts:
