    <h1>About</h1>
    <p id="main_p">Hi, we're team Cherry. The idea of our site is to give some basic knowledge about programming for the ones that are interested.</p>
    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>We are students from ELSYS and we are in 8th grade. We are studying programming and we are interested in web development. We got a project in one of our special subjects and decided that with it we are also going to help others learn about programming languages</p>
    <h2>Our goal</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to help people learn about programming languages and how to use them. We want to make programming more accessible and understandable for everyone.</p>
    <h2>Our future</h2>
    <p>We are planning to expand our site and add more content about programming languages, tutorials, and resources for learning. We want to create a community where people can share their knowledge and help each other.</p>
    <h2>Meet the team</h2>
    <p>The team consists of three members - Martin, Daniel and Petar. We are all students in TUES in the 8th grade. We teamed up knowing we can rely on each other.</p>
